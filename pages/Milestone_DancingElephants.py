### üåæ Symbolism
The fifth bloom ‚Äî *The Age of Dancing Elephants* ‚Äî represents **transformation and self-realization**.  
In Chinese culture, ‚ÄúËàûË±°‰πãÂπ¥‚Äù marks the transition from youth to maturity,  
when a young person learns to carry both strength and tenderness in equal measure.  

This bloom is no longer soft or fiery ‚Äî it is steady, grounded, and aware.  
It stands for the moment when the boys of *Teens in Times* grew into young men,  
ready to bear the weight of meaning, creation, and responsibility.

### üêò Event
During this stage, the group entered university life while balancing intense schedules.  
They faced sleepless nights, long rehearsals, and quiet solitude behind campus walls.  
It was a time of exhaustion and longing ‚Äî  
but also one that revealed their astonishing discipline and self-drive.  

As the world debated their future, the boys kept walking,  
turning confusion into conviction.  
Their documentary *The Age of Dancing Elephants* captured this exact crossroad ‚Äî  
when the spotlight dimmed, yet their inner light began to glow from within.  

It was no longer about fame.  
It was about asking deeper questions:  
**‚ÄúWho are we becoming? What does it mean to grow, to create, to stay kind?‚Äù**

### üå± Garden Meaning
This bloom embodies **growth through reflection**.  
It reminds us that every dream must pass through the stage of questioning ‚Äî  
that real strength is built not in applause, but in persistence.  

Like the elephants of the earth, slow yet powerful,  
*TNT* learned to move with patience and purpose.  
Their journey became not just a story of idols,  
but a story of **youth finding meaning** in their own way.  

In our *Garden in Time*, this transforming bloom whispers:  
> ‚ÄúTo dance is not to escape the storm, but to learn to move within it.‚Äù
