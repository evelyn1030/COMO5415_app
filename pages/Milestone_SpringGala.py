### ‚ú® Symbolism
The fourth bloom bursts open like a sunrise ‚Äî dazzling, confident, and full of vitality.  
After walking through quiet nights and unseen rehearsals, the boys finally stepped into a light  
that reached millions.  

This bloom represents **recognition and pride** ‚Äî  
the moment their long-nurtured sincerity was seen by the world.  
It was not just a performance, but a declaration:  
that hard work, kindness, and belief in one‚Äôs craft can truly illuminate a national stage.

### üåü Event
In **February 2021**, *Teens in Times* appeared on the **Spring Festival Gala**,  
the most watched show in China.  
They performed under the grand lights, standing shoulder to shoulder with senior artists ‚Äî  
no longer the unknown boys from practice rooms,  
but representatives of a new generation,  
bringing fresh energy to a stage watched by millions of families.  

That night, their song carried warmth and youth across the country.  
It wasn‚Äôt only a milestone in career,  
but a quiet promise to continue shining ‚Äî  
for every dream that once felt small, for every young person still trying.

### üåø Garden Meaning
The *Radiant Bloom* embodies **recognition, hope, and shared light**.  
It teaches that when one bloom shines, its glow can touch countless others.  
This was the moment when their personal growth became a collective pride ‚Äî  
not only for fans, but for everyone who witnessed their journey from obscurity to brilliance.  

In our *Garden in Time*,  
this bloom stands for the first dawn that painted the whole sky golden ‚Äî  
proof that light, when born from sincerity,  
will always find its way. üåÖ
