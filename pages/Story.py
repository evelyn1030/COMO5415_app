** Animated Short: A Fox's Endless Summer Journey** 

This animated short tells a heartwarming story of loneliness and growth. On its endless journey, a lost little fox sits alone under an apple tree. 
Its world changes when a glowing butterfly appears, guiding it into a vibrant hydrangea field. 
There, it encounters a beautiful hydrangea (representing Teens in Times), and its healing song helps the fox find a new sense of belonging.

The friendship gives the fox courage and strength. Under a beautiful sunset, they promise to meet again at the top of a distant mountain. 
The fox then begins a new journey, heading towards the dawn, in a story filled with hope and love. 
The animation ends with the message, **"Our journey never ends. To be continued,"** symbolizing the eternal bond between the group and their fans.


**Act 1 ‚Äî Loneliness under the Apple Tree**  
A quiet field. A heavy apple tree at center. A small fox sits with its back to us, the sky a muted gray.  
*Emotion:* loneliness, confusion, longing.  
*On-screen:* *Alone, under the apple tree.*

**Act 2 ‚Äî A Butterfly‚Äôs Guidance**  
A tiny glowing butterfly slips from the leaves and dances before the fox. The fox looks up; curiosity and hope flicker.  
*Emotion:* curiosity, calling, first hope.  
*On-screen:* *A tiny light appears.*

**Act 3 ‚Äî Encounter in the Summer Field**  
The fox follows into a radiant hydrangea sea ‚Äî **Endless Summer**. One bloom shines brighter than the rest: a symbol of *Teens in Times*.  
*Emotion:* surprise, discovery, meeting.  
*On-screen:* *Into the endless summer.*

**Act 4 ‚Äî Song and Friendship**  
The fox and the special hydrangea stand side-by-side. Petals sway like music; a gentle song fills the air.  
*Emotion:* friendship, joy, healing.  
*On-screen:* *A song that heals, a bond that grows.*

**Act 5 ‚Äî Sunset and a Promise**  
They watch the sunset together; the sky glows in orange and violet. The fox lifts a small travel bundle, eyes bright with resolve.  
*Emotion:* warmth, encouragement, new resolve.  
*On-screen:* *Together, we watch the setting sun.*

**Act 6 ‚Äî Toward the Peak**  
The fox sets out toward a distant mountaintop. The hydrangea remains, smiling across the field. Dawn lights the ridge.

**Final card:** *Our journey never ends. See you at the top. To be continued.*
